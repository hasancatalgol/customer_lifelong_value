## What is Customer Lifetime Value?

Streamlit is an open source app framework in [Python](https://www.python.org/) language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.
In this repo, I made a Streamlit App from my previous work.
Customer lifetime value (CLV, or CLTV) is a metric that indicates the total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer account throughout the business relationship. To further understand the project, I highly recommend reading the article.
